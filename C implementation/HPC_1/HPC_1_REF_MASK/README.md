In "HPC1_RefreshMasks_inside_hpc", the RefreshMasks (Algorithm 7 in "Horizontal side-channel attacks and countermeasures on the ISW masking scheme")
is considered to be a part of the body of HPC_1. 


In "HPC1_RefreshMasks_outside_hpc", the RefreshMasks (Algorithm 7 in "Horizontal side-channel attacks and countermeasures on the ISW masking scheme")
is considered to be computed in advance.
