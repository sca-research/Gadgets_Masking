HPC_1: Fig.2 (c)  in "Hardware Private Circuits: From Trivial Composition to Full Verification"
*/

In this implementation,the "RefreshMasks" is Algorithm 7 in "Horizontal side-channel attacks and countermeasures on the ISW masking scheme".


In "HPC1_RefreshMasks_inside_hpc", the RefreshMasks is considered to be a part of the body of HPC_1. 


In "HPC1_RefreshMasks_outside_hpc", the RefreshMasks is considered to be computed in advance.
